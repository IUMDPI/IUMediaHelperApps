# IUMediaHelperApps
This is the repo for the MDPI utilities that are required to run on the desktop of media engineers and QC operators.

The two core utilities in this repository are the [IU Media Helper Recorder](Recorder/README.md) and the [IU Media Helper Packager](Packager/readme.md): 

* the [IU Media Helper Recorder](Recorder/README.md) provides a graphical user shell for FFMPEG, allowing video engineers better control over the video capture and processing pipeline.
* the [IU Media Helper Packager](Packager/readme.md) is a post-processor that normalizes and embeds metadata into files generated by the audio and video engineers.

For more details about each of these applications, please see the readme files in their repective repository folders.
